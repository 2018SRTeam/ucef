	<h2 class="section-title">UCEF is an open-source tool kit that provides a collaborative experiment-development environoment.</h2>
	<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and its partner, the Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University,
	have developed a collaborative experiment development environment across heterogeneous architectures integrating best-of-breed tools
	including programming languages, communications co-simulation, simulation platforms, hardware in the loop, and others. 
	This environment combines these simulators and emulators from many researchers and companies with a standardized communications protocol, 
	IEEE Standard 1516 High Level Architecture (HLA).
	</p>
	
	NIST is hosting a workshop on July 27, 2017, at the NIST Campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
	At this workshop, participants will learn the details of UCEF; 
	obtain a copy that they can install at the workshop and take home with them on a USB drive; 
	and participate in a hands-on exercise to design/implement/build a collaborative experiment involving all attendees.
	</p>
	We are looking for practitioners of these technologies who may be interested in not only using UCEF, 
	but more importantly in contributing to its development and evolution. 
	</p>
