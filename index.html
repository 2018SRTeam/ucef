<p style="line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Upcoming Webinar: Universal CPS Environment for Federation (UCEF) BETA Release (September 14, 2018, 11:00 a.m. EDT)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">NIST will host a one and one half hour webinar&mdash;from 11:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., EDT, on September 14, 2018&mdash;to present the next release of the </span><a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/cyber-physical-systems/ucef-universal-cps-environment-federation"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Universal CPS Environment for Federation (UCEF)</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">. This new release (our BETA version) incorporates lessons learned through early usage and </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">adds several substantial components to the UCEF repertoire&mdash;LabVIEW, GridlabD, Omnet++, and COA. These are in addition to native Java and C++ applications. </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The BETA version also features a universal gateway component that was developed to facilitate integration of domain-specific tools used in cyber-physical systems (CPS).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The webinar will be open to the first 100 participants to log in or call in. To join the webinar by computer, please go to </span><a href="https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/832557933"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/832557933</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">. To join by telephone, please call 1(408)650-3131 and use the access code (32557933#).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left; font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The UCEF development team has been hard at work this past year, readying a release of the UCEF Virtual Machine for general use in constructing simulations integrating tools from best of breed simulation environments, native languages, and hardware emulators and hardware in the loop. Developed through a collaboration between NIST and Vanderbilt University, UCEF has been infused with the knowledge and experience of a decade of research on collaborative experimental platforms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Developers who attended the </span><a href="https://appam.certain.com/profile/web/index.cfm?PKWebId=0x14555479a"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">workshop that introduced the ALPHA version last summer</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> were able to install the UCEF Virtual Machine and begin developing a collaborative experiment run that same day with 25 participating laptops over a local WiFi network. Those who participate in the upcoming September 14 webinar, or view the archived version when it becomes available, should be equally well prepared to explore the BETA version.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">UCEF meets an important need of the CPS community. CPS contain co-engineered, interacting networks of physical and computational components from many different technology domains. Each of these domains (e.g., smart grid, smart cities, smart manufacturing, smart transportation, smart home, etc.) has technologies and simulation engines tailored to its individual needs and experiences.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">CPS experimentation, therefore, often requires the integration of these heterogeneous, domain-specific tools into a common co-simulation platform. UCEF is an open-source tool set that is designed to be integrative, reproducible, scalable, and usable, thereby addressing various challenges and concerns that currently limit CPS experimentation and research.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>

	<h2 class="section-title">UCEF is an open-source tool kit that provides a collaborative experiment-development environment.</h2>
	<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and its partner, the Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University,
	have developed a collaborative experiment development environment across heterogeneous architectures integrating best-of-breed tools
	including programming languages, communications co-simulation, simulation platforms, hardware in the loop, and others. 
	This environment combines these simulators and emulators from many researchers and companies with a standardized communications protocol, 
	IEEE Standard 1516 High Level Architecture (HLA).
